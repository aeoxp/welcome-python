This function, `get_user_words`, will:
1.  Print a friendly message to start.
2.  Use `input()` three times to ask for a noun, a verb, and an adjective.
3.  Use `.strip()` on each input to remove any accidental spaces at the beginning or end of the words.
4.  Finally, it will return all three words together in a `tuple`. The example code shows you how to call the function and unpack the returned words into separate variables.
